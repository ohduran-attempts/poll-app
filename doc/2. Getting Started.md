# Starting a project
A project is a collection of settings for an instance of Django.
```
mysite/
   __init__.py
   manage.py
   settings.py
   urls.py
```
- ``__init__.py``: File for Python to treat the project directory as a package.
- ``manage.py``: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project.
- ``settings.py``: Configuration for this project.
- ``urls.py``: URL declarations for the project, like a table of contents.

__It's not a good idea to put any of this Python code within your web server's document root, because in doing so you risk the possibility that people will be able to view your code over the Web.__

**Put your code in some directory outside of the document root.**

## The Development server
Django includes a built-in, lightweight Web server you can use while developing your site, so that development is faster, without having to deal with configuring your production server (e.g., Apache) until ready for it.

Do so by running this:
```shell
python manage.py runserver
```
See Chapter 20 for information on how to deploy Django.
